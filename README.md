# Job Board

The project aims to build a web-based platform for managing job applications. It is designed using Spring Boot with Gradle for dependency management and build automation. Following a layered architecture—consisting of controllers, services, and repositories—it ensures a clean separation of concerns. The platform will allow job seekers to browse and apply for jobs, while employers can post and manage job listings.
